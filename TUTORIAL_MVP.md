# Suno MCP Server MVP - Quick Start Tutorial

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and use the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the Suno MCP server with Claude Desktop. This version allows basic song generation and custom song generation with your own lyrics.

## 1. Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the server ready.

**a. Install Python:**
*   Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   Verify your installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running: `python --version` or `python3 --version`.

**b. Install Dependencies:**
*   Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory (the one containing `requirements.txt`).
*   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*   Install the required packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**c. Get Your Suno Cookie:**
*   Log in to your Suno account at [suno.com](https://suno.com/).
*   Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12).
*   Go to the "Network" tab.
*   Refresh the Suno page or perform an action (like generating a song).
*   Look for requests made to `studio-api.suno.ai` or similar Suno API endpoints.
*   Click on one of these requests and find the "Request Headers" section.
*   Locate the `cookie:` header. You need to copy the **entire value** of this header. It will likely contain multiple parts separated by semicolons, such as `__client=...; sid=...;`.

**d. Set up the `.env` File:**
*   Find the file named `.env.example` in the project directory.
*   Make a copy of this file and rename the copy to `.env`.
*   Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
*   Paste the **entire** Suno cookie string you copied in the previous step as the value for `SUNO_COOKIE=`. Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the cookie value unless they were part of the original cookie string.
    ```dotenv
    # Example .env content (replace the value with your actual cookie)
    SUNO_COOKIE=__client=YOUR_COPIED_CLIENT_PART; sid=YOUR_COPIED_SID_PART; other_parts...

    # You can leave other settings like TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY blank for the MVP
    TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY=
    ```
*   Save and close the `.env` file. The application will load this variable automatically.

## 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Now, let's tell Claude Desktop how to find and run your Suno server.

**a. Find the Configuration File:**
*   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   Tip: Type `%APPDATA%\Claude` into the Windows File Explorer address bar and press Enter.
*   **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   Tip: In Finder, click "Go" in the menu bar, hold down the Option key, and click "Library". Then navigate to `Application Support/Claude`.

**b. Edit the Configuration:**
*   Open `claude_desktop_config.json` with a text editor. If the file doesn't exist, create it.
*   Add the following JSON configuration. If the file already has a `"mcpServers": {}` section, just add the `"suno"` part inside the existing curly braces `{}`.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "suno": {
          "command": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
          "args": ["-m", "src.main"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *   **Path Note:** The example above uses the path to a Python executable in a virtual environment. Make sure to adjust these paths for your specific setup:
        *   For the `command` value: Use the full path to your Python executable (with double backslashes on Windows)
        *   For the `args` value: The `-m src.main` approach uses Python's module import system
        
    *   **Important Path Fix:** If you're getting errors about the server not finding the main.py file:
        *   Option 1: Make sure Claude Desktop is running from your project's root directory
        *   Option 2: Use the full path to main.py instead of the module approach:
            ```json
            {
              "mcpServers": {
                "suno": {
                  "command": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
                  "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\\src\\main.py"]
                }
              }
            }
            ```
    *   Ensure the path in `"args"` (`"src.main"`) is correct relative to where Claude Desktop will execute the command (usually the project root if configured as above).

**c. Restart Claude Desktop:**
*   Completely close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

**d. Verify Connection:**
*   Once Claude Desktop restarts, look for a small **hammer icon** (ðŸ”¨) in the bottom status bar or near the chat input area. This indicates that Claude has successfully connected to your local MCP server. If you hover over it, it should mention "suno".

## 3. Using the Suno Tools (MVP Features)

You can now use the `@suno` command in Claude Desktop.

**a. Simple Song Generation:**
*   Type a prompt describing the song you want.
    ```
    @suno generate a funky disco track about dancing robots
    ```
    Or:
    ```
    @suno generate a sea shanty about finding treasure on a remote island
    ```

**b. Custom Song Generation (Lyrics):**
*   Provide lyrics and optionally a style/genre tag.
    ```
    @suno create a custom song with the style "acoustic folk ballad" and the following lyrics:

    [Verse 1]
    Sunrise paints the mountains gold
    A story whispered, centuries old
    River flows, a steady friend
    On this quiet path, time transcends

    [Chorus]
    Oh, the simple life, a gentle breeze
    Rustling through the ancient trees
    Finding peace in morning light
    Everything just feels so right
    ```

Claude will process the request using your local server, and the generated audio should appear in the chat interface shortly after.

## 4. Testing Your Server Setup

Before using the server with Claude Desktop, you can verify that it's running correctly using the included test script:

```bash
# Run the server in one terminal (HTTP mode on port 8000)
python -m src.main

# In another terminal, run the test script
python manual_server_check.py
```

If the server is running correctly, you should see:
```
Testing MCP server availability at http://localhost:8000/health...
âœ… Success! MCP server is running (Status code: 200)
```

If you're using a different port or endpoint, you can specify it:
```bash
python manual_server_check.py http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Understanding MCP Server Transport Modes

The MCP server can run in two primary transport modes:

1. **HTTP Mode** (default for testing): When you run `python -m src.main` directly, the server starts in HTTP mode on port 8000 by default. This is what the manual_server_check.py script checks.

2. **IO Mode** (used by Claude Desktop): When Claude Desktop launches the server via the configuration in `claude_desktop_config.json`, it runs in IO mode (stdio), which means it communicates through standard input/output streams rather than HTTP. This is why you don't need to specify a port in the Claude Desktop configuration.

You can explicitly control the transport mode when running the server directly:

```bash
# Run in HTTP mode (for testing)
python -m src.main --transport http --port 8000

# Run in IO mode (simulates how Claude Desktop runs it)
python -m src.main --transport stdio
```

### Recommended Testing Method: Using the FastMCP Client

The most reliable way to test your MCP server is using the built-in FastMCP Client, which works with both transport modes:

```bash
# Run the client-based test script
python test_mcp_client.py
```

This approach directly connects to your MCP server using the same mechanisms that Claude Desktop uses, providing a more accurate test of your server's functionality.

## 5. Common Troubleshooting Tips

*   **No Hammer Icon (ðŸ”¨) in Claude:**
    *   **Restart Claude:** Did you fully restart Claude Desktop after editing the config file?
    *   **Check Config Path:** Double-check the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
        *   Is the `"command"` path to Python (especially if using a venv) correct?
        *   Is the `"args"` value correct? If using `["-m", "src.main"]`, Claude Desktop must be running from your project's root directory. If that's not working, try using the full path to main.py instead: `["C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\\src\\main.py"]`.
        *   Syntax errors in the JSON can also prevent loading.
        *   **Transport Mode Note:** Remember that Claude Desktop uses IO mode (stdio) to communicate with the server, not HTTP. The test script checks HTTP connectivity (port 8000), which confirms your server code is working, but Claude Desktop connects differently.
    *   **Test Server Directly:** Use the included test script to verify your server is running correctly:
        ```bash
        python manual_server_check.py
        ```
        This will check if the server is accessible via HTTP (port 8000) and help diagnose connection issues.
    *   **Run Manually:** Open your terminal, activate your virtual environment (if used), navigate to the project root directory, and run the command from your config file manually: `python -m src.main`. Does it start without errors? Watch the terminal output for clues. Fix any errors reported there.
    *   **Check `.env`:** Ensure the `.env` file exists in the project root and `SUNO_COOKIE` is set. The server might fail to start if the cookie is missing.
*   **Errors During Song Generation:**
    *   **Check Logs:** Look at the terminal window where your server is running (if you ran it manually) or check Claude's output. Errors from the Suno API might be shown there.
    *   **Cookie Issues:** The most common problem is an invalid or expired `SUNO_COOKIE` in your `.env` file. The cookie might expire after a day or two. Repeat Step 1c to get a fresh cookie and update your `.env` file. Ensure the *entire* cookie value was copied correctly.
    *   **Suno API Changes:** Suno's internal API can change without notice. If it stops working suddenly, the server code might need an update. Check the project's repository or community channels for recent updates or known issues.
    *   **Rate Limits/Usage:** You might hit usage limits on your Suno account. Check your account status on the Suno website.

That's it for the MVP! Enjoy generating music with Suno and Claude.
